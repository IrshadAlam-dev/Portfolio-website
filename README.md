🚀 Portfolio Website – Enhancement & Modernization

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website and documents the planned enhancements to modernize the UI/UX, improve recruiter impact, accessibility, and overall performance.

🔗 Live Portfolio:

📌 Objective

The goal of this enhancement is to transform the existing portfolio into a modern, recruiter-friendly, and accessible web presence that clearly communicates:

Who I am

What I do

What I’ve built

What I’ve learned as a developer

The focus is on clarity, usability, and real-world engineering best practices, not just visuals.

🧠 Key Improvements Overview
✅ UI / UX Modernization

Improved typography hierarchy (Headings, body text, spacing)

Consistent color theme using CSS variables

Modern button styles with hover and focus states

Cleaner section separation and layout structure

✅ Projects Section Redesign (Major Update)

The existing project section will be fully restructured into detailed, informative project cards.

Each project card will include:

Project image

Project title & description

Tech stack (tag-based)

Key features

What I learned from building it

Live Demo link

GitHub Repository link
